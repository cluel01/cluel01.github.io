In this project, I developed a highly efficient Python library for k-d trees using Cython. k-d trees are a data structure that is used to organize points in a k-dimensional space. They are commonly used in search applications, where the goal is to find the nearest neighbor of a query point. The compute intensive parts of the data structure are implemented in Cython, which is a superset of the Python programming language that allows for the creation of C extensions for Python. This allows for a significant speedup in performance compared to a pure Python implementation.

The code for this project can be found in the following <a href="https://github.com/cluel01/py_kdtree">Github repository</a>.
