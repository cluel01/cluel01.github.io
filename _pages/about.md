As a PhD candidate in the [Machine Learning and Data Engineering](https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/department/dasc) lab at the University of Münster, I am on track to complete my degree by Summer 2024. My passion for deep learning and large-scale computing drives my research, which is focused on their applications in search engines. I am eager to embrace new challenges and seek opportunities to expand my expertise in these fields.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
